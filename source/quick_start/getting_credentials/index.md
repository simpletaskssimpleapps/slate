# Getting Credentials

To get initial credentials you can follow these steps:

1. [Request a Trial](https://developer.dowjones.com/site/global/request-trial/index.gsp).
2. A Dow Jones representative will reach out and help match your use case with our products.
3. You will receive an email with (depending on products)
    1. API Key
    2. User/Pwd
    3. Tokens
    4. Link to details

You can then use the relevant authentication method of your API to connect and specific SFTP or SSH connection details for feeds.
