# Overview

Dow Jones Identity Service is an authorization and authentication framework based on the [OAuth 2.0](#oauth-20) protocol and uses <a href="http://openid.net" target="_blank">OpenID Connect</a>. It provides secure access to Dow Jones' protected resources through REST APIs.

Before using the Dow Jones Identity Service with a client application, register the client application with Dow Jones to receive a client ID and a client secret. Customers and partners that want to access these APIs should contact their Dow Jones Account Manager or [service@dowjones.com](mailto:service@dowjones.com).
